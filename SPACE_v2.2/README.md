# Adosia SPACE IO Shield v2.2 - [Buy Adosia IoT Hardware](https://adosia.io)

Adosia SPACE v2.2 is part of Adosia's open hardware IO platform initiative to enable anyone to easily create a variety of custom WiFi control systems using the Adosia IoT Platform.

The SPACE v2.2 IO shield is designed to be pin compatible with the popular open hardware Arduino Uno R3 and WEMOS D1R2 WiFi controller boards.

The default open source software to connect your ESP8266-based SPACE v2.2 IO hardware (compatible with WEMOS D1R2 or WEMOS D1 Mini) to the Adosia IoT Platform and download the latest Adosia binary can be found [here](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-token/tree/master/hardware/bluponix/space_v2.2/sample_code/).
