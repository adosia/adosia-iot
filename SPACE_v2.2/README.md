# Adosia SPACE IO Shield - [Buy Adosia IoT Hardware](https://adosia.io)

Adosia SPACE IO boards are part of Adosia's open hardware IO platform initiative to enable anyone to easily create a variety of custom WiFi control systems using the **Adosia IoT Platform**.

The SPACE IO shield is designed to be pin compatible with the popular open hardware **Arduino Uno R3** and **WEMOS D1 R2 WiFi** controller boards.

Use the Arduino IDE and Adosia's open source [phoenix connect script](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-iot/tree/master/SPACE_v2.2/adosia_phoenix) to connect your ESP8266-based SPACE IO hardware
(compatible with WEMOS D1 R2 or WEMOS D1 Mini) to the Adosia IoT Platform which automatically downloads the latest Adosia binary.
